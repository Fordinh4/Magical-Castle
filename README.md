- This is my third multiplayer game project, in which players explore a magical castle full with diamonds and magical doors that can bring them to another room or transport them to an entirely new one. Each room may include a diamond, wormhole, or portal, and prizes and threats are distributed at random. Collect diamonds to get points, and keep an eye out for wormholes that will transport them to a random room. If players come across a portal, it will return them to the room with the castle entry door.

## What is the objective of the game?
- The objective of the game is to explore the castle, collect as many diamonds as possible, and leave the castle as quickly as possible while opening the correct door in the exit room. 
- The player needs to use their problem-solving skills to navigate through the castle, taking into account the random distribution of treasures and threats, blocked doors, and the possibility of being teleported to a different room. 
- The game presents a challenge that requires the player to strategically plan their moves, and with only one entrance and exit, success is based on making the right choices.

## How to play this game?
- Explore the castle by moving through the magical doors (North, South, East, and West), and collecting diamonds for points. 
- Be cautious of wormholes and portals, and find the correct door to exit the castle
## What did I learn from this project?
- Improved my experience with algorithm coding, input validation, exceptions, linked lists and graphs, and data structures with encapsulation.
